## Computational neuroscience seminar 

### When and Where: 
Each Wednesday at 11am both in-person (Prague, Malostranské náměstí 25, room 510) and remotely ([Zoom link](https://cuni-cz.zoom.us/j/99670017268))

### Synopsis

This seminar will focus on familiarizing participants with the latest advances in the field of computational neuroscience. It will be a mixture of invited talks, journal paper reviews and discussion sessions. The seminar is open to all those interested in neuroscience, particularly from the point of view of modelling of the neural systems.
All participants are encouraged to present and actively take part in discussions. Order of presenters, as well as seminar topics with be planned during the course of the semester with appropriate time in advance.

### Requirements for students to gain credits

To obtain credits, it is required to attend at least 10 seminars, actively participate in the discussion and present one journal article during the course or the semester.
