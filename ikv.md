## NAIL088: Informatics and Cognitive Science 2

### Synopsis

This course gives an introduction into computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. 
The second term will focus primarily on visual system, computational modelling, memory systems, spatial cognition, motor systems, 
but neural and behavioral learning will also be covered. Starting from school year of 2017/2018 this lecture is given in English. 

###  <span style="color:red"> Announcement </span>

The EXTRA lectures given by our INVITED GUEST, [Kamil Vlcek](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamil_Vlcek) from the Department of Neurophysiology of Memory of The Czech Academy of Sciences will take place:
-- 17th April (17:20 – 18:50) and -- 24th April (17:20 – 18:50); both times in S6. We hope you will come all! :) If you cannot attend, please drop us an
