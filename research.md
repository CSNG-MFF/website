### Research background


By training I am a theoretical computer scientist with the focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Towards the end of my
studies, I have increasingly often tapped neuroscience and psychology for inspirations on how to build intelligent systems.
This dual interest lead me to join a program in [Neuroinformatics](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/) at the [Unviersity of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), where my interest in the brain
grew further, eventully leading to my PhD thesis on the topic of [Development of functional properties in primary visual cortex](https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/4875) under the
supervision of [James Bednar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/). My first post-doctoral post was in the lab of [Tom-Mrsic Flogel](http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/groups-platforms/overview/unit/mrsic-flogel/) at UCL where I had the chance to
brush up my machine learning skills while investigating novel ways to estimate receptive fields in local populations of mouse
primary visual cortex neurons. Currently I am further pursuing my interset in the visual cortex at <a href="http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/teams.html">UNIC</a> CNRS by building large-scale
comprehensive model of cat primary visual cortex.

### Available student projects

This is a list of projects available for interested students. Most projects are designed to be completed
within 3 to 6 month, but some can be expanded into full PhD scope. If you are interested in working on any 
of the following projects please [contact me](/index.html).


* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project1').toggle();">Graphical user interface for Mozaik datastore and analysis.</a>    
    <small id="project1" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
        Mozaik automatically records data from simulations, annotates it with metadata regarding experimental context, and stores
        them in an internal data-store. An query based interface allows analysis and visualization modules to efficiently navigate
        through the stored data based on the attached metadata. Currently, Mozaik offers only programatic API to perform these interactions
        with data-store. The goal of this project would be to write a graphical user interface frontend to the Mozaik data-store, that will
        allow users to conveniently and interactively navigate and select data from the data-store and subsequently execute on them anaysis and
        visualization routines from Mozaik libraries.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project2').toggle();">Mozaik data-store module based on object oriented database.</a><br>
    <small id="project2" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations,
        with a highly modular architecture. One of the core Mozaik modules is a data-store, in which recordings from simulations richly
        annotated with metadata regarding experimental context are stored. Currently the data-store module is implemented as a
        database-like system based on [Neo](http://neuralensemble.org/neo/) library for internal representation of recorded data. The goal of this project is to
        offer an alternative data-store module based around dedicated objective? database such as.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project3').toggle();">A model inspection/visualization tool for Mozaik</a><br>
    <small id="project3" style="display: none;">
    <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
    The [model of primary visual cortex](/projects.html) developed in our lab, and implemented in Mozaik, has a complex connectivity structure. 
    Although there are various tests that the connectivity has been realized as expected, currently, there is no easy way to 
    visualize the network spatial structure and connectivity in [Mozaik](https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik). The aim of this project is to develop a 
    model inspection and visualization tool, for Mozaik, possibly building on existing tools such as [ConnPlotter](http://arken.umb.no/~plesser/software.html), [Moogli](http://moose.ncbs.res.in/moogli/), and [NeurAnim](http://software.incf.org/software/neuranim).
