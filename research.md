### Research background


By training I am a theoretical computer scientist with the focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Towards the end of my
studies, I have increasingly often tapped neuroscience and psychology for inspirations on how to build intelligent systems.
This dual interest lead me to join a program in [Neuroinformatics](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/) at the [Unviersity of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), where my interest in the brain
grew further, eventully leading to my PhD thesis on the topic of [Development of functional properties in primary visual cortex](https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/4875) under the
supervision of [James Bednar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/). My first post-doctoral post was in the lab of [Tom-Mrsic Flogel](http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/groups-platforms/overview/unit/mrsic-flogel/) at UCL where I had the chance to
brush up my machine learning skills while investigating novel ways to estimate receptive fields in local populations of mouse
primary visual cortex neurons. Currently I am further pursuing my interset in the visual cortex at <a href="http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/teams.html">UNIC</a> CNRS by building large-scale
comprehensive model of cat primary visual cortex.

### Available student projects

This is a list of projects available for interested students or enthusiasts. Most are designed to be completed
within 3 to 6 month, but some can be expanded into longer projects even full PhD scope. If you are interested 
in working on any of the projects please [contact me](./index.html).

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project1').toggle();">Unifying retinal mozaik model with activity based development.</a>
    <small id="project1" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        During post-natal development, primary visual cortex undergoes remarkable functional organization resulting - among others - in expression
        of topologically smooth orientation map across it's surface. The most common type of explenation for this phenomena is activity based development,
        whereby internally generated or visually driven activity coupled with plasticity in the thalamo-cortical and corico-cortical pathway
        induces gradual establishment of the orientation maps. [LISSOM](http://ioam.github.io/topographica/Tutorials/GCAL_Tutorial.html) based familiy of models is an example of such activity + plasticity driven models.
        An alternative explanation has been proposed by [Ringach](http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/468) (see also [this](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n7/full/nn.2824.html)) , in which the initial orientation maps are directly established by
        the very specific geometric properties of retinal ganglion cells RFs positions in visual space: [retinal mozaiks](http://labs.nri.ucsb.edu/reese/benjamin/PubsRetinalMosaics.html). However, this explanation
        can account only for initial very weak orientation maps, and low orienation selectivities of individual neurons in particular, and it is clear that
        the system has to undergo major further refinement in order to match the experimentally observed adult state. The goal of this project is to combine
        the two hypothesis of orientation map development and investigate their possible interactions.
        Specifically retinal mozaiks will be introduced into a LISSOM model, thus inducing the initial orientation maps based on Ringach et al. theory.
        This will be followed by simulation of the activity and plasticity driven development, which should lead to refinement of the intial maps.
        The correspondance between the initial retinal mozaik induced map with the final developed map will be assesed, and possible advantages of such
        dual orientation map development mechanism will be investigated.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project8').toggle();">Open Vision project.</a>    
    <small id="project8" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations. Inspired by the [OpenWorm](http://www.openworm.org)
	initiative, this project strives to bring neural based modelling of vision to the public. It will seek to engage the cognitive sciences enthusiast community into
	coordinate effort to build a comprehensive model of early and higher vision. We envision multiple phases of the project: <br>
	(1) Build a server running mozaik based V1 model and serve it on the new Open Vision website. The website will allow any member of public to submit a video and receive back the responses of selected model cells.<br>
	(2) Develop a web frontend to the Mozaik toolkit and use it to expand the Open Vision website to allow full configuration of the served model. Publish more models and experimental protocols already develop in our group. <br>
	(3) Expand upon 1 and 2 to build full open science platform similar to OpenWorm project, and build striving community around it.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project2').toggle();">Embedding of detailed compartmental neuron models into large-scale model of V1.</a>    
    <small id="project2" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        One of the ongoing projects in our group is development of  <a href="./projects.html">large-scale integrative model </a> of cat primary visual cortex (V1).
        This model is based on the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adaptive_exponential_integrate-and-fire_model">Adaptive-Exponential Leaky Integrate and Fire</a> 
        neuron model, which reduces biological neurons to a point process, ignoring
        its geometrical properties. In this project student will embed single compartmental model of V1 pyramidal neuron into the large scale point process
        simulation available in the group, and investigate the behavior of the added detailed neuron under the influence of the input coming from the large scale 
        V1 simulation, focusing on properties influenced by the neuron's geometry.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project3').toggle();">Local-field potentials (LFP) in a large-scale model of cat primary visual cortex.</a>    
    <small id="project3" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        One of the ongoing projects in our group is development of  <a href="./projects.html">large-scale integrative model </a> of cat primary visual cortex (V1).
        [LFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field_potential) is an electrophysiological signal generated by the summed electric current flowing from multiple 
        nearby neurons within a small volume of nervous tissue. The goal of this project is to investigate the LFP signals that would be generated 
        in our simulations of V1. The V1 model under investigation does not explicitly  contain LFP signals, only the sub-threshold and spiking responses of 
        individual neurons are available. Therefore one of previously proposed models 
        of LFP signals such as [this one](https://github.com/INM-6/hybridLFPy) will be used to generate artifical LFP signals based on the outputs of the V1 simulation. 
        This will be followed by thourough analysis of the resulting LFPs and results compared to previous findings, including recent data recorded at <a href="http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/teams.html">UNIC</a> by the 
        <a href="https://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/teams/Research%20group%20of%20Yves%20Fr%C3%A9gnac">Yves Fr√©gnac group</a>.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project4').toggle();">Graphical user interface for Mozaik datastore and analysis.</a>    
    <small id="project4" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
        Mozaik automatically records data from simulations, annotates it with metadata regarding experimental context, and stores
        them in an internal data-store. An query based interface allows analysis and visualization modules to efficiently navigate
        through the stored data based on the attached metadata. Currently, Mozaik offers only programatic API to perform these interactions
        with data-store. The goal of this project would be to write a graphical user interface frontend to the Mozaik data-store, that will
        allow users to conveniently and interactively navigate and select data from the data-store and subsequently execute on them anaysis and
        visualization routines from Mozaik libraries.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project5').toggle();">Mozaik data-store module based on object oriented database.</a>
    <small id="project5" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations,
        with a highly modular architecture. One of the core Mozaik modules is a data-store, in which recordings from simulations richly
        annotated with metadata regarding experimental context are stored. Currently the data-store module is implemented as a
        database-like system based on [Neo](http://neuralensemble.org/neo/) library for internal representation of recorded data. 
        The goal of this project is to develop an alternative data-store module based around dedicated key-value database such as
        [BerkelyDB](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index.html) or [CodernityDB](http://labs.codernity.com/codernitydb/).

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project6').toggle();">A model inspection/visualization tool for Mozaik.</a>
    <small id="project6"  class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
        The [model of primary visual cortex](/projects.html) developed in our lab, and implemented in Mozaik, has a complex connectivity structure. 
        Although there are various tests that the connectivity has been realized as expected, currently, there is no easy way to 
        visualize the network spatial structure and connectivity in [Mozaik](https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik). The aim of this project is to develop a 
        model inspection and visualization tool, for Mozaik, possibly building on existing tools such as [ConnPlotter](http://arken.umb.no/~plesser/software.html), [Moogli](http://moose.ncbs.res.in/moogli/), and [NeurAnim](http://software.incf.org/software/neuranim).

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project7').toggle();">Deployment of Mozaik on a HPC platrform.</a>
    <small id="project7" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        [Mozaik](https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik) is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
        Mozaik depends on a moderate software stack including [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/) as a simulator independent
        model specification language, and [Nest](http://www.nest-initiative.org/) as the simulator of choice in our projects.
        Currently we deploy Mozaik (together with the software stack) on a local cluster, however already at this relatively 
        small scale we are aware of number of inefficiencies in terms of its performance in the parallel environment. Furthermore, in future we would like 
        to deploy Mozaik on a large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) platform such as [ADA](http://www.idris.fr/ada/). The goal of this project is to test and optimize Mozaik and it's underlying
        software stack to run efficiently on the local cluster, and subsequently scale it up to a large-scale HPC platform.
        This project is suitable for students with experience and interest in parallel programming and HPC.

* <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="$('#project8').toggle();">Sumatra integration with Mozaik.</a>    
    <small id="project8" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
        <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
        <a href="http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra/">Sumatra</a> is a tool for provenance tracking. Sumatra shares several features with Mozaik,  but it also 
        posses features that would enhance the Mozaik workflow. The goal of this project is to integrate Sumatra with Mozaik, and 
        remove overlapping features from Mozaik and delegating them to Sumatra, in line with long term goal of outsourcing 
        as much functionality from Mozaik to dedicated tools. This project is suitable for students with interest in Neuroinformatics
        and moderate skills in Python and versioning systems.
