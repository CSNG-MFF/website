By trying I am a theoretical computer scientist with the focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. But, towards the end of my
studies I have increasingly often tapped neuroscience and psychology for inspirations on how to build intelligent systems.
This dual interest lead me to do a program in *Neuroinformatics* at the *Unviersity of Edinburgh*, where my interest in the brain
grew further, eventully leading me to make a PhD on the topic of *Development of functional properties in primary visual cortex* under the
supervision of *James Bednar*. My first post-doctoral post was in the lab of *Tom-Mrsoc Flogel* at *UCL* where I had the chance to
brush up my machine learning skills whil investigating novel ways to estimate receptive fields in local populations of mouse
primary visual cortex neurons. Currently I am pursuing my interset in the visual cortex function
