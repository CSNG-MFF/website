We are always on a lookout for talented motivated young researchers or student to join our ranks. If our 
research caught your interest, and your skills fit the focus of our group  feel free to drop 
us an [email](/about.html) with description of why you are interested in joining us, and a CV.


### Current Fully-Funded Open Positions

#### 2 PhD and 1 Postdoc 3 year positions 

As a part of the Charles University [Primus](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-558.html) funding program we have
2 new PhD and 1 Postdoc positions available in our group starting in September 2020. 

The studentships are ideal for students who want to apply their computational and analytical skills to 
problems in neuroscience and related fields. Successful candidates will have a strong background in 
numerical sciences, such as computer science, math or physics, and a keen interest in shaping the future 
of neuroscience. For the PhD positions no previous experience in neuroscience is required.

The exact project topic is flexible but should fall within the confines of following areas:

* Large-scale spiking biophysical models of visual system
* Machine learning techniques for building data-driven models of early visual cortex
* Computational modelling of prosthetic vision systems
* Modelling of activity driven development of funcional visual system

Please look [here](/research.html) at examples of available projects, but we wellcome students with their own
project ideas, as long as they are aligned with the resarch focus of the group.
