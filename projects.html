    Computational neurosceince is shifting towards more heterogeneous models of neuronal circuits, and employment of complex experimental protocols.
    This increase of complexity is not sufficiently addressed by existing tool chains. *Mozaik* is a workflow system for
    spiking neuronal network simulations written in Python that integrates model, experiment and stimulation specification,
    simulation execution, data storage, data analysis and visualization into a single automated workflow. This way Mozaik increases the productivity of running virtual
    experiments on complex neuronal networks.

    One of the key goals of sensory neuroscience is to identify the relationship between stimuli and neural responses.
    A common approch of identifying the stimulus-response function is to present a large collection
    of stimuli while responses of sensory neurons are recorded. Numerous methods for estimating the stimulus-response function from such data has been
    proposed in the past but no took advantage of the known architecture of primary visual cortex (V1) and the fact that a local population of
    V1 neurons shares limited pool of thalamic inputs. In this project we investigate a novel method for estimating the stimulus-response function
    in a population of neurons that implicitly assumes the discussed architecture of V1.
