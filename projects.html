    Computational neurosceince is shifting towards more heterogeneous models of neuronal circuits, and employment of complex experimental protocols.
    This poses a challenge for existing tool chains, as the set of tools involved in a typical modeler's workflow is expanding concomitantly
    with growing complexity in the metadata flowing between them. To address these issues, we have developed Mozaik: a workflow system for
    spiking neuronal network simulations written in Python. Mozaik integrates model, experiment and stimulation specification,
    simulation execution, data storage, data analysis and visualization into a single automated workflow. Mozaik increases the productivity of running virtual
    experiments on highly structured neuronal networks by automating the entire experimental cycle.

    One of the key goals of sensory neuroscience is to identify the relationship between stimuli and neural responses.
    The most common approch of identifying the stimulus-response function is a data driven ?, in which animal is presented with large collection
    of stimuli while responses of neurons are recorded. Numerous methods of fitting such data to estimate the stimulus-response function has been
    identified in the past but no took advantage of the known architecture of primary visual cortex (V1) and the fact that a local population of
    V1 neurons shares limited pool of thalamic inputs. In this project we investigate a novel method for estimating the stimulus-response function
    in a local population of neurons that implicitly assumes the discussed architecture of primart visual cortex. We have shown that the novel method
    outperform state-of-the-art methods when applied to two-photon calcium recordings in local populations of mouse V1 neurons responding to series of
    flashed natural images.
