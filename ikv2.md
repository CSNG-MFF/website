## NAIL088: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience 2

### Synopsis

This course gives an introduction into computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. 
The second term will focus primarily on visual system, computational modelling, spatial cognition. 
This course runs in English. 

### Course work

Passing of the course requires three components:
* Active participation
* Computational neuroscience paper presentation: [the list](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=kZ7Pw9ZJFwcSggtmhmcsLkSBz98709VOFMX)
* Term project (in the form of report): [the assignment](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZwig9Zmegk2qg2tnQex3RaNKYcYpJ0Y3BX)

The term project will be an assignment, which will involve delivering a report on analysis of a model of mouse primary visual cortex.

### Lecture overview and slides

The course will take place every *Monday* at *14:00-17:10* in room *510*. 

The first 90 minutes will be a lecture followed by 90 minute exercise session.
The following schedule is provisional, it can change depending on availability of visiting lecturers.
