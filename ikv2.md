## NAIL088: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience 2

### Synopsis

This course gives an introduction into computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. 
The second term will focus primarily on visual system, computational modelling, spatial cognition. 
This course runs in English. 

### Course work

Passing of the course requires three components:
* Active participation
* Computational neuroscience paper presentation: [the list](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=kZ7Pw9ZJFwcSggtmhmcsLkSBz98709VOFMX)
* Term project (in the form of report): [the assignment](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZwig9Zmegk2qg2tnQex3RaNKYcYpJ0Y3BX)

The term project will be an assignment, which will involve delivering a report on analysis of a model of mouse primary visual cortex.

### Lecture overview and slides (year 2026)

The course will take place every *Tuesday* at *14:00-17:00*

The course is structured as 90 min lecture & 90 minute exercise session, but we will start with more lectures and 
excercise sessions will be concentrated towards the end of the semester.
The following schedule is provisional, it will be changed depending on availability of visiting lecturers.
