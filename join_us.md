Currently, _we do not have fully funded positions available_ , however see for alternative funding schemes below.


<!--
<center><h2 style="color:red;"> Open postdoctoral position focusing on computational modelling of early visual system and neuro-prosthetic system design. </h2></center>

**Multiple projects possible:**
* Modeling electrical stimulation in a spiking model of the primary visual cortex. The goal of this project is to understand how intra-cortical stimulation can be used to restore vision in blind subjects.
* Deep-neural networks in visual neuroscience, especially applications for understanding of visual perception under artificial cortical stimulation.
* Study of cortical dynamics of spontaneous or artificially evoked activity in the visual cortex.  
* Biologically detailed spiking large-scale models of early visual cortical pathway - from Retina to V4.


|:--|:-- |
|**Requirements:**     | Strong computational and analytical skills. Experience in computational modeling, spiking neural networks, machine learning or understanding of electric field propagation in biological mediums are of great advantage but not strictly required.|
|**Duration:**         | 2 years, with possible extension|
|**Funding:**          | Fully funded for 4 years|
|**Starting date:**    | Now
|**To apply, send:**   | Detailed CV and cover letter explaining your interests and how your skills align with our project to: antolikjan@gmail.com|

## Other funding opportunities

### PhD funding

- The PhD program of Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University. Any student that
  passes the entrance exam can be enrolled in this _funded_ PhD program. A successful candidate can
  expect an equivalent of gross income of 28000 Czk, which at the time of writing (10.10.2020) is
  approximatly 1050 euros per month. For more details contact [Ján Antolík](https://Antolik.net). 
  Additional funding schemes, such as teaching, mobility grants, or intra-university project grants 
  allow for further increases of the salary.

### Post-doctoral fellow funding

- Charles University is making yearly calls for [visting post-doctoral fellows](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-178.html),
  that come with 2 year contracts and attractive salary.

- The Faculty of Mathematics and Physics makes calls for visiting post-doctoral fellows with similar conditions. These calls are irregular, contact
  me for the current status.

- We can help you write a project for the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en). 
As Czech Republic is one of the Widening Countries, there are additional Widening Fellowships available within the MSCA-PF calls, as well as Czech national funding of the 
applications with high evaluation but no funding. This significantly increase the chance of the application being funded.

- Likewise, we can help you write a project for the [EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.embo.org/funding/fellowships-grants-and-career-support/postdoctoral-fellowships/).
Extra fellowships for Czech Republic also exist withing this funding scheme, further increasing the chances of success.

- Finally, we can help you write a grant for the Czech Granting Agency (GACR) [Incoming Post-doc grant](https://gacr.cz/en/types-of-grant-projects/) that funds 2 year post-doc 
stays at Czech institutions.

### Bilateral funding

- For students from France: [Barrande Funding Scheme](https://studium.ifp.cz/en/doctorants/barrande-fellowship-program/?fbclid=IwAR3r-ISWEpvANAmC5b5wdR7S4HKg54JphDiTXnJ1sL6C22REYRs8bnbwE7A)

- For students from V4: [Visegrad Scholarship Program](https://www.visegradfund.org/apply/mobilities/visegrad-scholarship/?c=how-to-apply)
