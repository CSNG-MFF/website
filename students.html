 <small id="project_electric_stim" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
 Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) describes the local stimulation of neurons in the cortex with penetrating electrodes. The technique enabled several breakthroughs in interfacing with the brain, among them the control of a cursor through neural activity in the motor cortex of a human patient and the visual perception of shapes in non-human primates. Only recently, a computational study presented a model unifying experimental observations how ICMS directly activates neurons in the close surrounding of the electrode: ICMS activates a sparse set of neurons around the electrode with the number of activated neurons in the sphere around the electrode tip decreasing over distance to the electrode. Yet, the way the brain responds to the direct activation of a set of neurons around the electrode with network activity (e.g. neural firing rates) remains poorly understood. The goal of this project is to implement an abstract model of ICMS for the our group’s large-scale model of cat primary visual cortex. Utilizing this model to simulate ICMS in cat primary visual cortex, the spatial extent of the network response to the stimulation shall be compared to the one reported in experimental recordings from monkey and human cortex.

New approaches to sensory prosthetics are being developed, wherby the cortex is stimulated via opto-genetic tools, which are being translated from mice to higher-order mammals including primates. However, it remains unclear how light activates optogenetically transfected neurons. We have recently developed computational simulations of how light propagates through neural tissue and how it activates a detailed morphological model of a V1 pyramidal (excitatory) neuron. It is of great interest to understand such light stimulation effects also in other morphological neural types, particularly in inhibitory neurons. In this project, the student will first learn to use the NEURON simulator and our existing simulation framework. In the following, they will integrate new single neuron models into the simulation framework and use them to simulate and analyze their neural activation through optogenetic stimulation.

Recently we have applied the large-scale models developed in our team to the problem of cortical visual prosthesis. New approach to sensory prosthetics is being developed,
wherby the the cortex is stimulated via opto-genetic tools, which are being translated from mice to higher-order mammals including primates. While all the technological components
of the visual prosthesis are still under development, an important question remains open: how to stimulate the cortex to elicit percepts that are close to those due to the perception
of the given stimulus under normal vision. This is where our large-scale modelling approach comes in. Using our V1 model simulations to test potenial stimulation strategies, we are
making progress at answering this question. Currently, we have gained insights
on how to eleicit simple canonical visual stimuli, specifically sinusoidal gratings. In the next step the student will be responsible for expanding the design and analysis to generic
stimulation protocol capable of eliciting arbitrary visual stimuli. The current protocol can be straightforwardly expanded to this general case . The student’t responsibility will be
to implement this new stimulation protocol in our simulation framework, test the protocol in our model of V1, and implement and perform all the required analysis. Strong programming and
analytical skills required. Knowledge of Python, computation neuroscience or neurobiology of visual system a plus.

 <small id="project_bioconstr" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
 Application of deep neural networks to large datasets of neural data recorded in response to library of visual stimuly become the dominant method of unraveling the function of neurons in visual cortex. The standard approaches however (i) ignore known anatomical  structure of visual cortex, (ii) use purely feed-forward NN as opposed to the intrinsically recurrent biological networks, (iii) only capture the mean steady state response. To address this, in this project you will build a DNN model composed of multiple recurrent neural network stages, that will be constrained to follow various know anatomical structures, and train the resulting model on fine temporal  recordings of V1 responses to natural images. This project can be further extended to explore the possibility of pretraining the resulting model with contrastive unsupervised learning method recently used by <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.18.541361v1">DiCarlo lab for training DNNs for modeling ventral visual pathway</a>.  <br />

 Recent years have witnessed a major breakthrough in DNN models ability to predict neural population activity of V1 neurons to novel visual stimuli. The inverse problem of predicting the natural image based on the activity it elicits in population of V1 neurons, however, remains much less studied, and consequently mastered. In this project the student will implement and test a novel DNN architecture designed to predict visual inputs from population activity of V1 neurons.

 Recently a novel method of  studying coding properties of neurons in the visual system has been developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0517-x">ref</a>.
 It is based on two steps. First a forward deep neural network model - a model that predicts responses on neurons to images - is trained on neural recordings. Next
 by applying backpropagation to the model while keeping its weights fixed, a maximally exciting image is determined. Even more recdntly, this methods has been extended
 to identify the maximally exciting and maximally inhibiting modulatory surround stimuli <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.13.532473v1.full.pdf">ref</a>.

 In this project student will apply this new method to synthetic responses of neurons from our large-scale model of V1 to (a) determine wether our model conforms 
 to the aforemntioned recent experimental findings and (b) to obtain a mechanistic understanding how the discovered surround modulation effects emerge in cortical network.

 This is an ideal introductory project to get acquainted with spiking neural networks, models of visual system, and our Mozaik simulation framework, and hence gateway to more advanced modelling projects. It is thus suitable as a volunteer project or bachelor thesis. The goal of the project is to take a model cortico-thalamic loop that was developed by a PhD student a while ago in a very old version of our simulator  environment <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.521069v1">Mozaik</a> and port it into the current version of the simulator. The main challange of the project will be to get acquinted with the simulator stack, understand the code of the model, and then once the porting is done, which in itself should be straighforwad, to repeat the series of virtual experiments undertaken in the linked original study and verify that all results still hold in the ported model version.

 ON and OFF pathways in the early visual system were long thought of as symmetric in their spatiotemporal properties. However, lately there has been a collection of studies in the retina (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-07-02737.2002">Chichilnisky 2002</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1005846107">Ratliff 2010</a>, <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/45/9728">Sneha 2018</a>) and in the visual cortex (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472100005X">Rahimi-Nasrabadi 2021</a>), which show significant differences between the two pathways, mirroring the statistical differences in natural scenes.

Since, we have expanded the model in different directions in several followup studies: <a href="http://www.theses.fr/2018USPCB083">addition of cortico-thalamic loop</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88960-8">simulation of proshetic vision</a> , and <a href="">exploration of conductance dynamics</a>.

Recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17936">work</a> by Alonso Lab has shown that thalamic ON and OFF afferents converging onto neurons in primary visual cortex
have a very specific organization, which is OFF dominated, OFF centric and runs orthogonal to ocular dominance columns. Our current <a href="./research.html">large-scale integrative model </a>
of V1 does not feature this specific organization of thalamo-cortical afferents. The goal of this project will be to integrate this specific thalamo-cortical convergence

One of the ongoing projects in our group is development of <a href="./research.html">large-scale integrative model </a> of cat primary visual cortex (V1).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field_potential">LFP</a> is an electrophysiological signal generated by the summed electric current flowing from multiple
nearby neurons within a small volume of nervous tissue. The goal of this project is to investigate the LFP signals that would be generated
in our simulations of V1. The V1 model under investigation does not explicitly contain LFP signals, only the sub-threshold and spiking responses of
individual neurons are available. Therefore one of previously proposed models
of LFP signals such as <a href="https://github.com/INM-6/hybridLFPy">this one</a> will be used to generate artifical LFP signals based on the outputs of the V1 simulation.
This will be followed by thourough analysis of the resulting LFPs and results compared to previous findings, including recent data recorded at <a href="http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/teams.html">UNIC</a> by the

 <small id="project_tw" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
During spontaneous activity, mammalina cortex exhibits regular spontaneous emergence of waves of activity that travel across the cortical surface.
Furthermore, spatially, these waves tend to be correlated with the functional organization across cortical surface. Such highly structured spontaneous
activity, present even in low-level sensory cortical areas, has been hypothesized to be linked to such phenomena, as imagination, dreams, formation
of long-term memory and other high-level cognitive phenomena. In this project student will explore the presence of such spontaneos waves in our comprehensive model
of cat primary visual cortex. He/she will expand the <a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> framework with the ability to record Local Field Potential
type of signal. Perform experiments in which the waves will be recorded and will compare such in-silico generated data to in-vivo data from our international collaborators.

 <small id="project_s1" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
 We have recently developed a method for decoding functional organisation, specifically orientation maps, from spontaneous population activity in primary visual cortex.
 Apart from teaching us about the nature of spontaneous activity in cortex, this is a crucial step for developing future visual neuro-prosthetic devices for vision restoration.
 In this method we used a PCA method to identify a low-dimensional subspace of the spontaneous population activity in which the orientation maps reside. Interestingly, these 
 were not the first 2 PCA components but components 3-5. But what do the first two components correspond to? Our hypothesis is that they correspond to large-scale, perhaps
 whole brain, spontaneous waves, that are know to be present. In this project you will test this hypothesis by analysing a unique state-of-the-art data from 10 Utah electrode
 arrays implanted accross V1,V2 and V4 of 2 macaque monkeys.

 Both traveling waves and oscillations have been observed in the primary visual cortex, but their relationship is unclear. The aim of the project is to   first detect traveling waves in electro-corticographic recordings from the primary visual cortex of a cat and subsequently to analyze the spectral properties of the signal during the ocurrence of traveling waves. The question whether traveling waves lead to an increase of power in the gamma frequency band is of particular interest.

 Topological methods offer a promissing new direction in the analysis of neural data [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03664-4">Saggar 2018</a>]. It was previously reported that population activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys occupies a sphere [<a href="https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193262">Singh 2008</a>]. The aim of this thesis is to replicate the study by Singh et al 2010 for population activity generated synthetically by a large-scale model of a cat V1 [<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/416156v4">Antolík 2019</a>] and investigate robustness of the topological structure of the activity to parameter changes.

 The activity elicited in the primary visual cortex (V1) by a visual stimulus may directly reflect its spatial properties such as the frequency of spatially periodic structure.

It would be particularly interesting to compare the topological properties of activity triggered by natural vs artificial stimuli such as drifting gratings typically used in experiments.

 <small id="project_body" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
This project is performed in tight collaboration with the robotics group of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/matejhof/home">Matej Hoffman</a>.
The goal of this project is to explain how body representations can be learned in humanoid robots during
haptic self-exploration based on inputs provided by ‘artificial skin’ covering the robot’s body.
We hypothesize that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3082289/pdf/fncom-05-00017.pdf">our model of cortical development proposed</a>
can aid this goal in following two ways:  (i) the model itself, when fed with the somatosensory data will form effective,
biologically plausible representation of body surface, (ii) the novelty signal that can be straightforwardly
obtained from the model can within the closed loop paradigm guide self-exploration behavior towards efficient
exploration of the body space. The novelty signal is readily available in the model, as novel inputs are poorly
represented by the evolving cortical representation and thus the input will have high distance from the most representative
(close within input space) cortical neuron. Thus a simple winner-take-all mechanism at the cortical level, that outputs
the distance between the input and the point in input space the winner neuron represents will yield effective novelty signal.
The student will test these hypotheses in collaboration with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/matejhof/home">Hoffman group</a> guided by following milestones. He/she will
implement and validate the model of somatosensory map formation from artificial skin inputs, implement the novelty signal extraction
mechanism, test its impact on map formation in closed-loop system, integrate the resulting model within the humanoid
robotic system at Hoffman group, and perform experiments to confirm effectiveness of the model and search for bio-morphic
correlates in the resulting behavior.

in early post-natal V1 in ferrets, before eye opening, is already highly structured with spontaneous spatial correlations that are linked to the
orientation maps that develop few days later. Furthermore, it was shown, that no afferent input from thalamus (or retina) is needed for these
structure in spontaneous activity to appear. The authors hypothesize, that local maxican-hat-like connectivity that is anysothropic is 
sufficent for such correlation patterns to appear. In this project we will verify the hypothesis that the anaysothropy of local connections, which
is questionable, is not neccesary if hebbian learning on the cortico-corticl synapses is assumed, and furthermore, such mechanisms can explain
further development and refinenement of orientation maps. The goal of this project is to build a firing-rate model with hebbian-learning that 
will demonstrate test this hypothesis.

 <small id="project_dev_ON_OFF" class="studentprojectlist" style="display: none;">
During post-natal development, primary visual cortex undergoes remarkable functional organization resulting in expression
of topologically smooth orientation map across it’s surface. The most common type of explenation for this phenomena is activity based development,
whereby internally generated or visually driven activity coupled with plasticity in the thalamo-cortical and corico-cortical pathway
induces gradual establishment of the orientation maps. <a href="http://ioam.github.io/topographica/Tutorials/GCAL_Tutorial.html">LISSOM</a> based familiy of models is an example of such activity + plasticity driven theoretical explanation of this phenomena.
Recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17936">work</a> by Alonso Lab has shown that thalamic ON and OFF afferents converging onto neurons in primary visual cortex
have a very specific organization, which is OFF dominated, OFF centric and runs orthogonal to ocular dominance columns. The current activity driven models of V1 development
cannot explain this specific organization of thalamo-cortical afferents. The goal of this project will be the expand these models to account for these new findings.

During post-natal development, primary visual cortex undergoes remarkable functional organization resulting - among others - in expression
of topologically smooth orientation map across it’s surface. The most common type of explenation for this phenomena is activity based development,
whereby internally generated or visually driven activity coupled with plasticity in the thalamo-cortical and corico-cortical pathway
induces gradual establishment of the orientation maps. <a href="http://ioam.github.io/topographica/Tutorials/GCAL_Tutorial.html">LISSOM</a> based familiy of models is an example of such activity + plasticity driven models.
An alternative explanation has been proposed by <a href="http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/468">Ringach</a> (see also <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n7/full/nn.2824.html">this</a>) , in which the initial orientation maps are directly established by
the very specific geometric properties of retinal ganglion cells RFs positions in visual space: <a href="http://labs.nri.ucsb.edu/reese/benjamin/PubsRetinalMosaics.html">retinal mozaiks</a>. However, this explanation
can account only for initial very weak orientation maps, and low orienation selectivities of individual neurons in particular, and it is clear that
the system has to undergo major further refinement in order to match the experimentally observed adult state. The goal of this project is to combine
the two hypothesis of orientation map development and investigate their possible interactions.
Specifically retinal mozaiks will be introduced into a LISSOM model, thus inducing the initial orientation maps based on Ringach et al. theory.
This will be followed by simulation of the activity and plasticity driven development, which should lead to refinement of the intial maps.
The correspondance between the initial retinal mozaik induced map with the final developed map will be assesed, and possible advantages of such
dual orientation map development mechanism will be investigated.

<a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations,

initiative, this project strives to bring neural based modelling of vision to the public. It will seek to engage the cognitive sciences enthusiast community into
coordinate effort to build a comprehensive model of early and higher vision. We envision multiple phases of the project: <br />
(1) Build a server running mozaik based V1 model and serve it on the new Open Vision website. The website will allow any member of public to submit a video and receive back the responses of selected model cells.<br />
(2) Develop a web frontend to the Mozaik toolkit and use it to expand the Open Vision website to allow full configuration of the served model. Publish more models and experimental protocols already develop in our group. <br />
(3) Expand upon 1 and 2 to build full open science platform similar to OpenWorm project, and build striving community around it.

<a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
Mozaik automatically records data from simulations, annotates it with metadata regarding experimental context, and stores
them in an internal data-store. An query based interface allows analysis and visualization modules to efficiently navigate
through the stored data based on the attached metadata. Currently, Mozaik offers only programatic API to perform these interactions
with data-store. The goal of this project would be to write a HTML based graphical user interface frontend, to the Mozaik data-store, that will
allow users to conveniently and interactively navigate and select data from the data-store and subsequently execute on them anaysis and
visualization routines from Mozaik libraries.<br />

<a href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a an automated workflow for large-scale neural simulations.
Mozaik depends on a moderate software stack including <a href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> as a simulator independent
model specification language, and <a href="http://www.nest-initiative.org/">Nest</a> as the simulator of choice in our projects.
Currently we deploy Mozaik (together with the software stack) on a local cluster, however already at this relatively
small scale we are aware of number of inefficiencies in terms of its performance in the parallel environment. Furthermore, in future we would like
to deploy Mozaik on a large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) platform such as <a href="http://www.idris.fr/ada/">ADA</a>. The goal of this project is to test and optimize Mozaik and it’s underlying
software stack to run efficiently on the local cluster, and subsequently scale it up to a large-scale HPC platform.
This project is suitable for students with experience and interest in parallel programming and HPC.
