<h3 id="project-description">Project description</h3>

<p>Modern deep learning has revolutionized visual neuroscience by greatly enhancing the ability to predict cortical neuron responses to novel visual stimuli. However, current approaches face two key limitations. First, they typically predict only average neural responses, failing to capture the rich temporal dynamics within recurrent neural populations. Second, they rely on generic architectures optimized for training efficiency rather than reflecting the biological systems they aim to model. As a result, these models operate as black boxes, limiting our ability to interpret their representations in terms of biological visual processing. These shortcomings constrain their potential to uncover principles of vision or inform clinical applications such as brain-machine interfaces.</p>

<p>To overcome these challenges, we will develop novel, modular, multi-layer recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that directly reflect the architecture of the primary visual cortex. Our models will map individual neurons across visual processing stages to their artificial counterparts, explicitly incorporating key biological features: functionally specific lateral recurrence, excitatory and inhibitory cell types, complex adaptive neuron transfer functions, synaptic depression, and more. We will first train these RNNs on synthetic data generated from a state-of-the-art biologically realistic spiking model of the visual cortex developed in our lab. Once validated, we will apply the models to publicly available mouse and macaque datasets, as well as data from our experimental collaborators.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-offer">What do we offer</h3>

<p>The position is fully funded for 2 years, and comes with a salary equivalent to ~2400 EUR/month. We offer a dynamic international working environment and collaborations with world-leading experimental labs (Stanford,
University of Pennsylvania, Institute de la Vision Paris etc.).</p>

<h3 id="candidate-profile">Candidate profile</h3>

<p>PhD degree. Strong background in modern machine learning techniques. Prior experience with training recurrent neural networks, and neuroscience or related disciplines is an advantage, but not strict requirement.</p>

<!--
<center><h2 style="color:red;"> Open postdoctoral position focusing on computational modelling of early visual system and neuro-prosthetic system design. </h2></center>

**Multiple projects possible:**
* Modeling electrical stimulation in a spiking model of the primary visual cortex. The goal of this project is to understand how intra-cortical stimulation can be used to restore vision in blind subjects.
* Deep-neural networks in visual neuroscience, especially applications for understanding of visual perception under artificial cortical stimulation.
* Study of cortical dynamics of spontaneous or artificially evoked activity in the visual cortex.  
* Biologically detailed spiking large-scale models of early visual cortical pathway - from Retina to V4.

<h3 id="phd-funding">PhD funding</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The PhD program of Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University. Any student that
passes the entrance exam can be enrolled in this <em>funded</em> PhD program. A successful candidate can
expect an equivalent of gross income of 28000 Czk, which at the time of writing (10.10.2020) is
approximatly 1050 euros per month. For more details contact <a href="https://Antolik.net">Ján Antolík</a>. 
Additional funding schemes, such as teaching, mobility grants, or intra-university project grants 
allow for further increases of the salary.</li>
