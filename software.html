                Computational neurosceince is shifting towards more heterogeneous models of neuronal circuits, and
                employment of complex experimental protocols.
                This increase of complexity is not sufficiently addressed by existing tool chains. <a
                    href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">Mozaik</a> is a
                workflow system for spiking neuronal network simulations written in Python that integrates model,
                experiment and stimulation specification,
                simulation execution, data storage, data analysis and visualization into a single automated workflow.
                This way Mozaik increases the productivity
                of running virtual experiments on complex neuronal networks. Download Mozaik on <a
                    href="https://github.com/antolikjan/mozaik">GitHub</a> or read about it <a

                The multi-faceted development in computational neuroscience towards more integrative approaches and more
                intense communication poses major new challenges for modelers, as currently there is a lack of tools
                that help with automatic communication of all aspects of a simulation workflow to the rest of the
                community. To address this important gap, we introduce <a href="http://arkheia.org/">Arkheia</a>.
                Arkheia is a web-based open science platform for computational models in systems neuroscience. It
                provides an interactive, graphical presentation of simulation results, experimental protocols, and
                interactive exploration of parameter searches, in a web browser-based application. <a
                    href="http://Arkheia.org/">Arkheia</a> is focused on automatic presentation of these resources with
                minimal manual input from user. It is designed in an open manner, with a clearly defined and separated
                API for database access, so that any project can translate its data into the <a
                    href="http://arkheia.org/documentation/api">Arkheia database format</a>. Download Arkheia on <a
                    href="https://github.com/antolikjan/Arkheia">GitHub</a>, or read about it <a
