<h4 id="-2-phd-and-1-postdoc-3-year-positions-"><span style="color:red"> 2 PhD and 1 Postdoc 3 year positions </span></h4>

<p>As a part of the Charles University <a href="https://cuni.cz/UKEN-558.html">Primus</a> funding program we have
2 new PhD and 1 Postdoc positions available in our group starting in September 2020.</p>

<p>The studentships are ideal for students who want to apply their computational and analytical skills to 
problems in neuroscience and related fields. Successful candidates will have a strong background in 
numerical sciences, such as computer science, math or physics, and a keen interest in shaping the future 
of neuroscience. For the PhD positions no previous experience in neuroscience is required.</p>

<p>The exact project topic is flexible but should fall within the confines of following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large-scale spiking biophysical models of visual system</li>
  <li>Machine learning techniques for building data-driven models of early visual cortex</li>
  <li>Computational modelling of prosthetic vision systems</li>
  <li>Modelling of activity driven development of funcional visual system</li>
</ul>

<p>Please look <a href="/research.html">here</a> at examples of available projects, but we welcome students with their own
project ideas, as long as they are aligned with the resarch focus of the group.</p>

<p>Blindness is the most feared handicap leading to the greatest exclusion from society by reducing patient autonomy and mobility. Clinical trials have demonstrated the possibility to regain some useful vision with retinal prostheses in patients having lost photoreceptors. New approaches are entering into clinical trials such as photovoltaic implants, optogenetic therapy and even cortical prostheses for patients having lost eye to brain connection. In the <a href="http://www.entrain-vision.eu/">ENTRAIN-VISION</a> project, the Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) will work on these innovative technologies for restoring vision in blind patients. Their training in academic institutes or industry will be completed by several secondments, including at least one at an industry partner. In addition, several summer schools will address scientific subjects on vision restoration and transferable skills in technology transfer, clinical trials, start-up creation, and communication to the media.</p>

<p>In our team, we will address the problem of how to encode visual stimulus, such that the stimulation of the targeted visual processing stage (retina, thalamus or cortex) leads to perception of the given stimulus by the implanted subject. We will address this question via computational means, relying on both large-scale recurrent spiking neural network models of early visual system, as well as novel deep neural network machine learning techniques. This way, we will inform the future design of the visual prosthetic devices and contribute to the information processing software that will run on the implanted hardware.</p>

<p>What we offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Obtain a PhD from Charles University in Prague.</li>
  <li>Internships at technological innovators <a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatric</a> and <a href="https://goodai.com/">GoodAI</a>, and 3 month secondment at another ENTRAIN-VISION partner (see attachments for full list).</li>
  <li>Work in close collaboration with the leading vision restoration lab of Dr. Serge Picaud at the <a href="http://www.institut-vision.org/en/"> Institute de la Vision </a>, Paris.</li>
  <li>A full-time 3-year paid contract, starting September 2020.</li>
</ul>

<p>Main tasks and responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building and testing large-scale recurrent spiking neural network models of early visual system.</li>
  <li>Extending these simulations with model of the prosthetic system, and calibrating the resulting simulation stack against physiological data provided by the project partners.</li>
  <li>Developing encoding schemes for visual stimuli that will provide both accurate and efficient stimulation of the neural visual substrate.</li>
  <li>Evaluating candidate encoding schemes in the simulation environment.</li>
  <li>Finding efficient implementations of the selected encoding schemes in the low-powered prosthetic hardware.</li>
</ul>
